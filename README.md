# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sonal Bhatia!

## 🚀 About Me
I'm an aspiring **AI/ML Engineer** with skills spanning across scientific programming in Python, software development in Java and C++, and a keen interest in the intersections of AI/ML, peformance analysis, robotics, and aerospace. 

From January - August 2025, I'm working as an AI Intern in the System Performance Architecture group within Hardware Engineering at Apple Inc. My opinions, repos and other content here are not a reflection of my employers, unless otherwise specified or agreed. I am making my contributions/submissions to the projects in my personal capacity and am not conveying any rights to any intellectual property of any third parties.

## 🛠️ Some of My Projects

### 📐 [Shap-E](https://github.com/s-bhatia1216/shap-e/tree/mps-support)
*APPLE: Enabling Shap-E to run on Apple Silicon GPUs via Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) Acceleration*
- **Overview:** Shap-E falls back to CPU on Apple M-series machines because certain indexing ops are not yet supported by PyTorch-MPS. This PR removes that blocker, giving native-GPU performance on macOS without sacrificing CUDA/CPU compatibility.
- **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch MPS
- **Features:** Significant performance increase while running Shap-E locally on Mac M-series, for example, on a Mac mini (M4 Pro), default image-to-3D generation time drops from 4 hours to just under 4 minutes when switching from CPU to GPU via MPS.
